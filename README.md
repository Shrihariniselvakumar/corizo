# NHANES Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for analyzing the NHANES dataset. The analysis explores various health and demographic factors and applies statistical techniques to derive insights.

## Overview

The NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) dataset provides a wealth of information about the health and nutritional status of the U.S. population. This project leverages the dataset to:

- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Visualize key trends and patterns.
- Apply statistical models to test hypotheses.

## Contents

- **NHANES_Analysis.ipynb**: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis.
- **data/**: A directory to store input datasets (if applicable).
- **results/**: A directory to store outputs such as plots or processed data (if applicable).
- **README.md**: Documentation for the repository.

## Prerequisites

Before running the notebook, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Required Python libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scipy` (install via `pip` or `conda`)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd your-repo-name
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *(Optional: Create a virtual environment before installing dependencies.)*

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook NHANES_Analysis.ipynb
   ```
2. Follow the steps in the notebook to perform the analysis. Ensure the dataset is placed in the `data/` directory, or update the file path accordingly.
